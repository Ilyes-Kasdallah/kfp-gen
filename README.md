🔹 data_collect/

Likely contains scripts and Jupyter notebooks to automate or streamline data collection. These may include:

    Connecting to data sources (APIs, databases, filesystems)

    Preprocessing or transforming data

    Organizing collected raw data for pipeline ingestion

🔹 testing-llms/

Presumably hosts resources for interacting with Large Language Models:

    Experimenting with prompts and model responses

    Evaluating LLM completions or outputs

    Integrating LLM steps into Kubeflow pipelines

🔹 .gitignore

Standard ignore file to keep unnecessary files (e.g., .pyc, notebook checkpoints, virtualenv folders, data dumps) out of Git.
Getting Started

    Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Ilyes-Kasdallah/kfp-gen.git
cd kfp-gen

Install dependencies
Likely requires:

    Python (e.g. 3.8+)

    kfp (Kubeflow Pipelines SDK)

    jupyter (for notebooks)

    Possibly LLM client libraries (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
    Suggested:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Explore directories

        data_collect/: find datasets and data pipeline code

        testing-llms/: find notebooks for LLM prompt testing
