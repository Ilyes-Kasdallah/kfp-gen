You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

This sample demonstrates a common training scenario. New models are being trained strarting from the production model (if it exists). This sample produces two runs: 1. The trainer will train the model from scratch and set as prod after testing it 2. Exact same configuration, but the pipeline will discover the existing prod model (published by the 1st run) and warm-start the training from it.
