You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Args:         model (Model): Input challenger model.         test_data (Dataset): Test dataset used for evaluating challenger model.         vertex_model (VertexModel): Output model uploaded to Vertex AI Model Registry.         model_eval_metricsn (Metrics): Evaluation metrics of challenger model.         project (str): project id of the Google Cloud project.         location (str): location of the Google Cloud project.         pipeline_job_id (str):         model_name (str): Name of champion and challenger model in             Vertex AI Model Registry.         eval_metric (str): Metric name to compare champion and challenger on.         eval_lower_is_better (bool): Usually True for losses and             False for classification metrics.         serving_container_image (str): Container URI for serving the model.         model_description (str): Optional. Description of model.         evaluation_name (str): Optional. Name of evaluation results which are             displayed in the Vertex AI UI of the challenger model. # Output google.VertexModel artifact # Parse metrics to dict # Compare models # Look up Vertex model evaluation for champion model
