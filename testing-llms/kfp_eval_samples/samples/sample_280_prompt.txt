You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Generate a random number between minimum and maximum (inclusive). Submit the pipeline for execution: kfp.Client(host=kfp_endpoint).create_run_from_pipeline_func(flipcoin_pipeline, arguments={}) # Compiling the pipeline # pipeline_func = noMerge_pipeline # pipeline_filename = pipeline_func.__name__ + '.pipeline.tar.gz'
