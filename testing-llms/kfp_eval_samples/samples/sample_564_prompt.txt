You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

A simple KFP component that takes an input string, appends a message,     logs it, and returns the new string. ./pipeline/components.py # For real MLOps, you might load data, preprocess, train, or predict here. # For this "Hello World", we just manipulate a string.
