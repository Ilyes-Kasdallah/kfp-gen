# $ python addition_pipeline.py # This will upload addition_pipeline.yaml. Check this on kubeflow-pipeline-ui # $ python addition_pipeline.py This will upload addition_pipeline.yaml. Check this on kubeflow-pipeline-ui  # Passes a pipeline parameter and a constant value to the `add_op` factory # function.
