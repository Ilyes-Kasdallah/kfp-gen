You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Prepare input/output paths and data input_data_gcs_dir = 'gs://<my bucket>/<path>/' output_data_gcs_dir = 'gs://<my bucket>/<path>/' Downloading the training set (to upload to GCS later) training_set_features_local_path = os.path.join('.', 'training_set_features.tsv')
