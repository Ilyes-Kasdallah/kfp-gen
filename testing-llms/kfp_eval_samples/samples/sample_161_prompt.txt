You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Load a pipeline object from the pipeline file.      Load a :class:`Pipeline` object from a pre-compiled file that represents     the pipeline.      Args:         filepath (Union[str, os.PathLike]): The path of the pre-compiled file that             represents the pipeline.      Raises:         ValueError: If the :attr:`filepath` file has an invalid schema.      Returns:         Pipeline: An object that represents the pipeline.      .. deprecated:: 0.6.0         Use :func:`.pipeline_parser.parse_pipeline_package` instead.
