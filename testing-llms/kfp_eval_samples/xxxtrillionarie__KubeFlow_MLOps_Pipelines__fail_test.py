```python
import kfp
from kfp import dsl

# Define the 'fail' component
@dsl.component(
    base_image="python:3.8",
    packages_to_install=["unittest"],
)
def fail():
    # Simulate a failure
    raise Exception("This is a simulated failure.")

# Define the V1 Legacy Engine pipeline
@dsl.pipeline(
    name="fail_pipeline",
    description="A pipeline that tests the failure handling of the 'fail' component.",
    mode=dsl.PipelineExecutionMode.V1_LEGACY,
)
def fail_pipeline():
    fail_task = fail()
    fail_task.after()

# Define the V2 Engine pipeline
@dsl.pipeline(
    name="fail_pipeline",
    description="A pipeline that tests the failure handling of the 'fail' component.",
    mode=dsl.PipelineExecutionMode.V2_ENGINE,
    alias="fail_v2_pipeline",
)
def fail_v2_pipeline():
    fail_task = fail()
    fail_task.after()

# Function to run the pipelines and verify their failures
def run_pipeline_func(mode):
    if mode == "legacy":
        kfp.compiler.Compiler().compile(fail_pipeline, "fail_pipeline.yaml")
        client = kfp.Client()
        run = client.create_run_from_pipeline_file("fail_pipeline.yaml", arguments={"mode": mode})
        while run.status.state != "SUCCEEDED":
            time.sleep(5)
        assert run.status.state == "FAILED"
    elif mode == "v2":
        kfp.compiler.Compiler().compile(fail_v2_pipeline, "fail_v2_pipeline.yaml")
        client = kfp.Client()
        run = client.create_run_from_pipeline_file("fail_v2_pipeline.yaml", arguments={"mode": mode})
        while run.status.state != "SUCCEEDED":
            time.sleep(5)
        assert run.status.state == "FAILED"

# Run the pipelines in both modes
run_pipeline_func("legacy")
run_pipeline_func("v2")
```

In this solution, we define a `fail` component that raises an exception to simulate a failure. We then create two pipelines, one using the V1 legacy engine and another using the V2 engine. Each pipeline includes the `fail` component and uses the `run_pipeline_func` to execute and verify the pipeline's failure handling. The `run_pipeline_func` checks the pipeline's status after each run to ensure it has failed.
