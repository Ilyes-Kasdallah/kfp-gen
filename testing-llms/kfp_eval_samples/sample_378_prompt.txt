You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

# load data artifact store # reshaping the data # reshaping pixels in a 28x28px image with greyscale, canal = 1. This is needed for the Keras API # normalizing the data # each pixel has a value between 0-255. Here we divide by 255, to get values from 0-1
