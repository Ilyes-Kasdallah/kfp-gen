This code snippet defines a Kubeflow Pipeline named `ml-demo` that performs a machine learning workflow consisting of three components. The pipeline uses the `kfp` and `kfp.dsl` libraries. It leverages GCP secrets via `use_gcp_secret('user-gcp-sa')` for authentication. The pipeline takes two arguments: `project` (string, representing the GCP project ID) and `bucket` (string, representing the GCP storage bucket).

The pipeline uses the `kfp` and `kfp.dsl` libraries, includes necessary imports, and ensures syntactic correctness. Do not include explanations, comments, or non-code content.
