```

This code snippet defines a Kubeflow Pipeline named `two-step-with-uri-placeholder` that performs two sequential steps. The pipeline takes a single string input, `msg`, which defaults to "Hello world!". The pipeline consists of two components: `write-to-gcs` and `read-from-gcs`. The `write-to-gcs` component writes the input string `msg` to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) location, and the `read-from-gcs` component reads the content of the GCS file specified by the `artifact` output from the previous component. The control flow is sequential: the `read_from-gcs` component executes only after the `write_to_gcs` component completes successfully. No parallel processing is involved. The pipeline utilizes the `google/cloud-sdk:slim` Docker image and the `gsutil` command-line tool for interacting with Google Cloud Storage.
