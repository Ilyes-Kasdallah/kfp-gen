You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

# mount_vol = kfp.dsl.VolumeOp( #     name="Read Ridhwan Volumes", #     size="1Gi", #     modes=kfp.dsl.VOLUME_MODE_RWO, #     resource_name="ridhwan-pvc-mount", # PVC Name, will be {pipeline_name}-{id}-resource if name does not exist and generate_unique_name is True.
