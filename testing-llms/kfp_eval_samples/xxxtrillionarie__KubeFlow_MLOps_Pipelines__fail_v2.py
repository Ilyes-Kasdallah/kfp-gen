```python
import kfp
from kfp import dsl

# Importing the sys module from the Python standard library
import sys

# Defining the fail component
@dsl.component(
    output_artifact=dsl.OutputArtifact(type=dsl.ArtifactType.DIRECTORY)
)
def fail():
    # Simulating a failure by exiting with a return code of 1
    sys.exit(1)

# Defining the main pipeline
@dsl.pipeline(name="fail-pipeline")
def fail_pipeline():
    # Executing the fail component
    fail_op = fail()

# Creating an instance of the pipeline client
client = kfp.Client()

# Submitting the pipeline run
run = client.run(pipeline_name="fail-pipeline")

# Printing the run ID
print(f"Pipeline run ID: {run.id}")
```

This code snippet defines a Kubeflow Pipeline named `fail-pipeline` that includes a single component, `fail`, which simulates a failure by exiting with a return code of 1. The pipeline is defined using the `@dsl.pipeline` decorator, and the `fail` component is defined using the `@dsl.component` decorator. The pipeline runs using the Kubeflow Pipelines client, and the run ID is printed to the console.
