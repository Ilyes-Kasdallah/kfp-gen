You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Components that matching cfg arguments which got `None` are excluded from the pipeline.         cfg arguments: is chooses in [args.cfg_train, args.cfg_record]     Args:         args : argparse # set config of model to training # set 0 when running for katib or in pod (not have enough shared memory) # If get dataset with dvc, load the paths from the database. # And all paths were set by dvc config # If get dataset with dvc, load the paths from the database.
