You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

# gen_name_comp = func_to_container_op(generate_inference_service_name) # gen_name_task = gen_name_comp(dataset_name, experiment_name) # model_name=sane_service_name, # model_uri="pvc://{}/{}".format(mount_name, experiment_name), # framework="pytorch",
