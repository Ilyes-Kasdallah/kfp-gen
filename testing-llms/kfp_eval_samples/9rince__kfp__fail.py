```python
from kfp import dsl
import kfp.components as comp

# Define the fail task component
@comp.component(base_image='alpine:latest')
def fail():
    # Simulate a pipeline failure by exiting with a return code of 1
    exit(1)

# Define the fail pipeline
@dsl.pipeline(name="fail_pipeline")
def fail():
    # Execute the fail task
    fail_task()
```

In this solution, we define a `fail` task component that uses the `alpine:latest` Docker image. The `fail` function simply exits with a return code of 1, simulating a pipeline failure. We then define a `fail` pipeline that contains only the `fail_task`. The pipeline is named "fail_pipeline".
