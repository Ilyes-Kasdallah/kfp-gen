You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Components for monitoring metrics, drift and retraining class FloatOutput(NamedTuple): float_value: float # train_query = f'SELECT * FROM {projectid}.{db}.{tablename} where data_type = "Train"' # train_df = pd.read_gbq(train_query, project_id=projectid, dialect= 'standard')
