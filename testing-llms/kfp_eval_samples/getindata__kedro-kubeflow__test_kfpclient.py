```python
from kfp import dsl

@dsl.component
def data_ingestion(input_path: str, output_path: str):
    # ... code to ingest data ...
    pass

@dsl.component
def data_processing(input_path: str, output_path: str):
    # ... code to process data ...
    pass

@dsl.component
def model_training(input_path: str, output_path: str):
    # ... code to train a model ...
    pass

@dsl.pipeline(name='test_kfpclient')
def test_kfpclient():
    ingestion = data_ingestion(input_path='/data/raw', output_path='/data/processed')
    processing = data_processing(input_path=ingestion.outputs['output_path'], output_path='/data/model')
    training = model_training(input_path=processing.outputs['output_path'], output_path='/model/final')
```

This code snippet defines a Kubeflow pipeline named `test_kfpclient` that performs a simple machine learning workflow. The pipeline consists of three components: `data_ingestion`, `data_processing`, and `model_training`. Each component has its own input and output parameters, mirroring those specified in the hypothetical pipeline. The pipeline's control flow is sequential, with each component running after the previous one.
