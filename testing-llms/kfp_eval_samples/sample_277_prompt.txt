You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Generate a random number between minimum and maximum (inclusive). # implement pip as a subprocess: # implement pip as a subprocess: #out2 = get_train_output_op(1000, out1.outputs['TRAIN_INPUT_JSON']) #output = train_evaluation_op(out1.outputs['TRAIN_INPUT_JSON'], out2.outputs['TRAIN_OUTPUT_JSON']) Submit the pipeline for execution:
