You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

# any attributes can be parameterized (both serialized string or actual PipelineParam) # pass in init_container list # pass in sidecars list # pass in k8s container kwargs # set `imagePullPolicy` property for `container` with `PipelineParam`
