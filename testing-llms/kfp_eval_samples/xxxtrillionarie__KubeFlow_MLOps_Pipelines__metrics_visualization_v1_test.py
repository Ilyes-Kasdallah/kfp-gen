```python
import kfp
from kfp import dsl

# Define the pipeline
@dsl.pipeline(name='metrics_visualization_v1_pipeline')
def metrics_visualization_v1_pipeline():
    # Placeholder for the single component
    pass
```

This code snippet defines a Kubeflow Pipeline named `metrics_visualization_v1_pipeline` using the `@dsl.pipeline` decorator. The pipeline does not contain any components yet, but it serves as a template for future implementations.
