This code snippet defines a Kubeflow Pipeline named `First Pipeline` that performs a classification task using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression algorithms. The pipeline consists of four components: `download`, `decision_tree`, `logistic_regression`, and `show_results`. The `download` component downloads the necessary data, which is then passed to both the `decision_tree` and `logistic_regression` components in parallel. The `show_results` component displays the accuracy results from both models. The pipeline uses Kubeflow Pipelines (kfp) and its DSL for definition.
