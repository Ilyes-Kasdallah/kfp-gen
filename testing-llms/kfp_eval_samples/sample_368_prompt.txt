You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Define a pipeline and create a task from a component: # You can optionally specify your own pipeline_root # pipeline_root='gs://my-pipeline-root/example-pipeline', # The outputs of the merge_csv_task can be referenced using the # merge_csv_task.outputs dictionary: merge_csv_task.outputs['output_csv']
