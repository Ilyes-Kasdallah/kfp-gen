You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

# Passes a pipeline parameter and a constant value to the `add_op` factory # function. # Passes an output reference from `first_add_task` and a pipeline parameter # to the `add_op` factory function. For operations with a single return # value, the output reference can be accessed as `task.output` or
