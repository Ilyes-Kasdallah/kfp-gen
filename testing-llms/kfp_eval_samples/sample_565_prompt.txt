You are an MLOps engineer. Write a Kubeflow pipeline based on the following description and code logic:

Defines the Hello World KFP pipeline structure.     It consists of a single component that processes an input message. ./pipeline/hello_pipeline.py # Terraform will pass a value for this. # Call the component, passing the pipeline parameter to its input. # In more complex pipelines, you would chain multiple components here.
