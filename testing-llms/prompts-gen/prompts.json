The model directory is specified as `gs://kubeflow-pipelines-demo/tfx/0b22081a-ed94-11e9-81fb-42010a800160/santander-customer-transaction-prediction-95qxr-268134926/data/export/export`.  If the `platform` is 'GCP', it uses the `model_dir` and `server_name` ('kfdemo-service') arguments. Otherwise, it uses `cluster_name` (from the pipeline's `project` input), `model_dir`, `pvc_name` (from a PersistentVolumeClaim created earlier), and `server_name`.  The output is an implicitly deployed model.\n\n2. **Web Application Component:** This component, defined inline, launches a web application using the image `us.gcr.io/kf-pipelines/ml-pipeline-webapp-launcher:v0.3`. It takes the argument `--model_name santanderapp`. This component depends on the successful deployment of the model.\n\n**Control Flow:**\n\n- If the `platform` is not 'GCP', a `VolumeOp` creates a PersistentVolumeClaim. A `ContainerOp` then clones a Git repository. Both of these operations are only executed in non-GCP environments.  The deployment component depends on this PVC creation (in non-GCP environments).\n- The web application component (`webapp`) depends on the successful execution of the deployment component.\n\n**Inputs/Outputs:**\n\n- The pipeline takes `output` (likely a directory path) and `project` (the Kubernetes project name or equivalent) as inputs.\n- The pipeline's output is implicitly the deployed model and launched web application.\n\n**Tools/Libraries:**\n\n- Kubeflow Pipelines (`kfp`, `dsl`, `components`)\n- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration (`gcp`) if `platform` is 'GCP'\n- On-premise support (`onprem`) otherwise\n- Git\n\n\nThe pipeline utilizes conditional logic based on the `platform` variable to adapt to different deployment environments (GCP vs. on-premise).  The `gcp.use_gcp_secret` and `onprem.mount_pvc` are used to handle GCP secrets and PVC mounting, respectively."

Inputs: `true_values`, `predicted_values`. Output: `mean_squared_error` (and other metrics).\n\nThe `train_until_low_error` sub-pipeline recursively calls itself using a `kfp.dsl.Condition` that checks if the `mean_squared_error` is greater than 0.01.

Specific transformations include:\n    * Setting `imagePullPolicy` to \"Always\" for the main container and sidecars matching the pattern \"f*\".\n    * Setting resource requests and limits (CPU and memory) for the main container using different methods (e.g., specifying tuples for requests and limits vs single values).\n    * Setting resource requests and limits for sidecars, handling both bulk updates and individual sidecar updates.\n    * Setting pod annotations and labels.\n\n\nThe pipeline's control flow is simple; all transformations are applied sequentially within the single component. No parallel processing or conditional logic is involved.  The component uses the `kfx.dsl._transformers` library from the Kubeflow Pipelines framework for transforming ContainerOps.

It's assumed this component uses basic string splitting functionality (e.g., splitting on spaces).  No specific libraries are explicitly mentioned in the code, but the implementation likely uses Python's built-in string manipulation functions.\n\n2. **`print_word` component:** This component takes a single string as input (`word`) and presumably prints it to the standard output.  It's a simple operation and doesn't involve any external libraries or complex computations.\n\nThe pipeline's control flow utilizes a `kfp.dsl.ParallelFor` loop. The `split_sentence` component runs first, and its output (`words`) is then iterated over using `ParallelFor`. For each word in the `words` list, the `print_word` component is executed concurrently.  Therefore, the `print_word` component has a dependency on the `split_sentence` component.\n\nThe pipeline uses the Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) v2 SDK along with YAML for component definitions.  Component definitions are loaded from a `component` directory using `kfp.components.ComponentStore`. The pipeline is compiled into a `pipeline.json` file and then deployed, likely to Google Cloud AI Platform Pipelines.  The pipeline takes a single parameter `sentence` which is set to \"Hello Vertex Pipelines\" at runtime. The pipeline's output is the result of each individual `print_word` task.  The pipeline utilizes custom container images, whose base images are defined in `component/*/component.yaml` files and overridden at runtime to use a project-specific service account."

It likely takes data as input and outputs `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test`.\n\n2. **`TrainPlot` component:** This component uses the `sklearn` library to train a linear regression model (`LinearRegression`) on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) received from the previous component. It then makes predictions on the test data (`X_test`). The component generates two scatter plots visualizing the training and testing data, along with the regression line. It calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Explained Variance Score (EVS) as evaluation metrics.  The outputs are the training and testing plots (implicitly, through the `plt.show()` calls) and a dictionary containing the calculated metrics (`mse`, `mae`, `evs`). It implicitly uses the `matplotlib` library (`plt`). It does not appear to have explicit parameters, though it depends on data from the previous component.\n\nThe pipeline's control flow is sequential: the `TrainPlot` component executes after the `traintest_op` component completes.  No parallel processing is involved.  The output of `traintest_op` (namely `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test`) serves as input to the `TrainPlot` component. The pipeline utilizes `sklearn` for model training and evaluation and `matplotlib` for plotting.  The code uses the `kfp` library for pipeline definition.  The `TrainPlot` component is packaged as a component and saved to `./components/train-plot.yaml`.\n\nThe prompt should instruct the LLM to generate both the pipeline definition using the `@dsl.pipeline` decorator and the component definition using the `@components.create_component_from_func` decorator, with the appropriate imports.  The LLM should infer the input/output data types based on the component's functionality description.  The LLM needs to replace the placeholders for the external component URL and the actual data manipulation within the pipeline."

The output is a single integer stored in the `output` file.\n\n3. **Print:** This component, called four times conditionally, prints a message to the console.  It takes a single string argument (`msg`) which is the message to print. It has no output.\n\n4. **Conditional execution logic:** The pipeline uses nested `dsl.Condition` statements to control the execution flow. If the coin flip results in \"heads\", a random number between 0 and 9 is generated. Based on whether this number is greater than 5 or less than or equal to 5, a corresponding message is printed.  Similarly, if the coin flip is \"tails\", a random number between 10 and 19 is generated, and another conditional print statement executes based on whether the number is greater than 15 or less than or equal to 15. The components are organized in a nested conditional structure.\n\nThe pipeline uses Python and the `kfp` library for Kubeflow Pipelines.  No external tools or libraries like scikit-learn or Snowflake are used.  The pipeline compiles to a YAML file."

    "structured_prompt": "Generate a Kubeflow Pipeline named `Execution order pipeline` that performs two simple echo operations.  The pipeline consists of two components:\n\n1. **echo1:** This component takes a single string input (`text1`, defaulting to 'message 1') and outputs the same string to the standard output. It uses a bash container (`library/bash:4.4.23`) to execute the echo command.  There is no explicit output defined, but the standard output is effectively the output.\n\n2. **echo2:** This component takes a single string input (`text2`, defaulting to 'message 2') and outputs the same string to the standard output.  Similar to echo1, it uses a bash container (`library/bash:4.4.23`) to execute the echo command.  There is no explicit output defined, but the standard output is effectively the output.\n\n\nThe control flow is sequential: `echo2` runs *after* `echo1` is complete. This dependency is explicitly defined using `step2_task.after(step1_task)`.  No parallel execution or loops are used.  The pipeline uses the `kfp` library for definition and compilation.  No external tools or libraries like scikit-learn or Snowflake are employed.  The pipeline is compiled into a YAML file for deployment on Kubeflow."

    "structured_prompt": "Generate a Kubeflow Pipeline named `Exit Handler` that performs a simple data download and echo operation, demonstrating the use of an exit handler.  The pipeline consists of three components:\n\n1. **`GCS - Download`:** This component downloads a text file from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) URL using `gsutil`.  The input is the GCS URL (`url`, defaulting to `gs://ml-pipeline/shakespeare/shakespeare1.txt`). The output is the downloaded file's content, stored as a text file named `/tmp/results.txt`.  The `google/cloud-sdk:279.0.0` container image is used.\n\n2. **`echo` (used twice):** This component simply echoes a given text string to standard output.  The first instance takes the downloaded file content from the `GCS - Download` component as input. The second instance is used as an exit handler and prints the string \"exit!\".  The `library/bash:4.4.23` container image is used.\n\n3. **Exit Handler:** The `echo` component printing \"exit!\" is wrapped in a `dsl.ExitHandler`. This ensures it runs regardless of whether the preceding tasks succeed or fail.\n\nThe pipeline's control flow is as follows:  The `GCS - Download` component runs first. Its output is then passed as input to the first `echo` component.  The second `echo` component (the exit handler) is guaranteed to execute after both other components complete, using the `dsl.ExitHandler` context manager. No parallelFor is used.  The pipeline utilizes the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK (`kfp` and `dsl`) and the `google-cloud-sdk` and `bash` container images."
